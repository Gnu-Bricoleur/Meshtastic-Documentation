Each button can be pressed up to 4 times in quick succession to access the second third and fourth character listed under it.
The shift button cycle between lower case letters, upper case, and numbers.

Using the UP and DOWN buttons the user can access preregistered canned messages (SELECT to send and CANCEL to go back).
Simply starting to type a text using the letter key will automatically open a free text input panel and allow the user to write the message to send using the SELECT key.
